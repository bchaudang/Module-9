## SQL Challenge - Employees

======================================================

This Challenge was divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis to research about employees who were employed at a fictional company during the 1980s and 1990s.

For the Data Modeling portion, I used the link given for QuickDBD as shown in class by our instructor.

Moving on to the Data Engineering, skills covered during class activities on how to create tables, columns and importing csv files using the query tool were used. Identifying the correct data types for the columns, primary key, foreign key and to properly reference the columns that corresponded.

The Data Analysis section, again as covered in class activities on how to extract data, join the tables as well as sorting.

====================================================

There were a few issues that I ran into while performing this assignment, which were that once I had created the ERD using QuickDBD, identifying some of the datatypes on pgAdmin, had to be changed. 
I has also created my tables first, than went back and referenced the correct foreign keyes to the other tables because I ran into issues loading the csv files because errors were appearing stating that the process had failed due to the syntax error of my datatypes being incorrect.

I also ran into an issue with the second question for the data analysis with finding employees who had been hired during 1986. It had ran without any errors, however no information was appearing in the tables for output. I realized that the format in which I wrote my date had to be changed to D/M/Y.

I utilized my weekly tutor session, aswell as askBCS, referred to class activities and also spoke to classmates as well. 
Overall, this assignment was not as time consuming as previous challenges, and was quite interesting to do.

=====================================================
RESUBMISSION: Due to a spelling error in my first reference line to dept_manager being mispelled as dept_managers has been fixed as advised by the Central Grader.
